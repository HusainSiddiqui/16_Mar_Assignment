    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and is unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. As a result, the model performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data. This can also lead to inaccurate predictions and poor generalization.\n",

    "- Regularization: adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the model from overemphasizing certain features.\n",
    "- Dropout: randomly dropping out neurons during training to reduce co-adaptation and force the model to learn more robust features.\n",
